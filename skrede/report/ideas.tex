\chapter{Ideas}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Encode more information in input to RNN? E.g. time.
	\item Use RNN to learn embedding space: SESSION\_2\_VEC
	\item Combine session output vectors to a user vector: USER\_2\_VEC
	\item Use word2vec to represent title of book. Give this as input to RNN (Or use vector representation of other types of input)
\end{itemize}
