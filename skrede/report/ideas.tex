\chapter{Ideas}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Encode more information in input to RNN? E.g. time.
	\item Use RNN to learn embedding space: SESSION\_2\_VEC
	\item Combine session output vectors to a user vector: USER\_2\_VEC
	\item Use word2vec to represent title of book. Give this as input to RNN (Or use vector representation of other types of input)
	\item Use LSTM (long term short term memory) or BRNN instead of GRN
\end{itemize}
